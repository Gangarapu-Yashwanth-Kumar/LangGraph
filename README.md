# LangGraph üöÄ

### About üí°
This repository is dedicated to showcasing powerful AI applications built using the LangGraph framework. Explore examples ranging from foundational chatbots to complex, multi-stage processing pipelines, all powered by Groq's Gemma2-9b-it Large Language Model. Dive into the world of stateful, agentic workflows!

### Features ‚ú®
* **Basic Chatbot:** A simple, direct conversational agent illustrating core LangGraph functionality.
* **Multi-Stage Pipeline:** Demonstrates advanced workflows including preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and logging, showcasing modular AI design.
* **Groq Integration:** Utilizes the high-performance Groq API for LLM inference with the Gemma2-9b-it model.
* **Jupyter Notebooks:** Interactive and easy-to-follow examples for quick setup and experimentation.

### Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

To run these notebooks, you'll need a Groq API key.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/LangGraph.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/LangGraph.git)
    cd LangGraph
    ```
2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Set Up Groq API Key:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the repository and add your Groq API key:
    ```
    GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"
    ```
    *Alternatively, set it as an environment variable in your system.*

4.  **Launch Jupyter Lab/Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Then, open the `.ipynb` files to explore the code.
